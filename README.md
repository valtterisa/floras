### Why Builddrr

Builddrr is designed for founders, marketers, and product teams who want **fast iteration** without sacrificing code quality.

- **AI-first workflow**: Describe your product and audience; Builddrr generates page structure, copy, and sections tailored to your use case.
- **Visual editor**: Drag, reorder, and tweak sections with instant preview instead of wrestling with code or templates.
- **Built for iteration**: Quickly adjust headlines, CTAs, and layouts to test new angles without touching your codebase.
- **Production-grade output**: Clean Next.js pages with sensible structure, SEO-friendly markup, and responsive design.
- **Integrated analytics & usage tracking**: Understand how your AI usage and features are being consumed across plans.

> **Use case examples**
>
> - Launch a new SaaS landing page in an afternoon.
> - Spin up variations of your pricing page for A/B testing.

- **AI**
  - Pluggable AI layer (see `lib/ai/*`) for chat, generation, and editing flows

### Quickstart

#### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

#### 2. Configure environment

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root and configure at least your Supabase and auth-related variables. You can also enable billing/usage tracking:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Polar / billing (optional, for paid plans & usage-based features)
POLAR_API_KEY=your_polar_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_POLAR_API_URL=https://api.polar.sh
```

If you are wiring this into a full billing setup, also make sure your Stripe/Polar settings match what’s in `lib/stripe.ts` and `lib/polar.ts`.

#### 3. Run the dev server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` and start creating landing pages.

> **Tip**
>
> You can explore the main in-app experience at the dashboard route under `app/(app)/dashboard` once you have auth and Supabase wired up.

### Architecture

At a high level, Builddrr coordinates:

```text
User action → AI layer (content & structure) → Editor + Preview UI → Deploy / Export
         ↓             ↓                           ↓
   Auth & teams   Usage tracking            Billing & limits
    (Supabase)   (Supabase + Redis)     (Polar.sh / Stripe integration)
```

From a code perspective, the flow looks like this:

1. **User initiates an action** (e.g. create page, refine section) from the dashboard/editor.
2. **API routes in `app/api/*`** orchestrate AI calls, apply business rules, and update Supabase.
3. **Editor state** is managed in the client (see `lib/editor-store.ts` and `components/editor/*`).
4. **Usage and billing hooks** (Supabase, Polar, Stripe) track consumption and enforce plan limits when configured.

### Key folders

- `app/(app)/dashboard/*` – main app flows and dashboard UI.
- `components/editor/*` – page editor, sections, and preview components.
- `components/landing-page/*` – marketing site sections and templates.
- `lib/ai/*` – AI prompts, orchestration, and streaming logic.
- `app/api/*` – backend endpoints for chat, generation, deploys, and usage.

### Contributing

This project is still evolving. Good first areas to explore or improve include:

- New section templates and layout variations.
- Better analytics and insights inside the dashboard.
- Additional AI editing tools and workflows.

If you do open a PR, aim to keep changes focused and well-scoped (e.g. “new editor section type” or “improved AI prompt for hero sections”) so the review surface is small and the intent is clear.
